# Giphygram

A sample Progressive Web App for displaying the top latest trending Gifs from [Giphy.com](https://giphy.com/)

The initial implementation is barebones HTML/CSS/JavaScript. It works ok in a browser on a device with a stable network connection, but will not work offline, and does not have advantages of a native app.
Following the PWA guidelines, the code in sequentially named branches is iteratively improved to have the app work even offline, and look and feel like a native app on mobile devices.  

This code with its iterations is taken from the Udemy course [Everything you need to build Progressive Web Apps from Scratch, or upgrade your existing Web Apps to PWAs](https://inrhythm.udemy.com/course/progressive-web-apps/learn/lecture/7880826#overview) by Ray Viljoen.

Note: for local dvelopment and testing, the site could be served for example:
- by a PHP server with a command like **`> php -S localhost:8000`**
- by the [Web Server for Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/web-server-for-chrome/ofhbbkphhbklhfoeikjpcbhemlocgigb/reviews) plugin
